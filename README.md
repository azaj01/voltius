## ⚡ Why Voltius?

I built Voltius because I couldn't find an SSH client that checked every box. I wanted a tool that was blazingly fast and lightweight, featured a modern UI, and came complete with the features I actually use like Cloud E2EE Sync, SFTP host<->host w/ drag & drop...

Most existing tools are either stuck in the 90s, feel bloated, or lock essential features like device syncing behind expensive subscriptions. This project is my "no-compromise" solution: a native-speed, professional terminal that respects your data and your workflow.

## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Local-First Core (Free Forever)
No account required. Your data, your machine.
- **Plugin system:**
- **Gist Sync**: Decentralized state-based E2EE sync using private Gists. Each device maintains its own encrypted "blob" in your private Gist. Pulls are triggered via interval polling to keep your devices in sync without a central server.
- **SFTP:** Host/Local <-> Host/Local, supports drag & drop
- **Identity Management:** Manage your SSH keys and credentials and reuse them across connections.
- **Jump Hosts:** Define a chain of jump hosts to connect to hard-to-reach servers (SSH Tunneling).
- **SSH Config Import:** Import your existing `~/.ssh/config` and keep it in sync (read-only).
- **SSH Agent Forwarding:** Forward your SSH agent to use local keys on remote hosts.
- **Environment Variables:** Set environment variables for each connection.
- **Custom Commands:** Define pre-connection and post-connection commands.
- **Import/Export:** No vendor lock-in, Import/Export your vaults in a few clicks
- **Docker:** Manager Docker resources and open terminals directly in Voltius.
- **Serial Console:** Connect to serial devices directly from Voltius.
- **System Monitoring:** Live CPU, memory, and disk usage stats from connected hosts.
- **Local Terminal:** Start local terminals (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, WSL, Git Bash, CMD, Cygwin, Cmder).
- **Port-Forwarding:** Automatic detection of open ports on connected hosts and one-click port forwarding.
- **Snippets**
- **Reachability checks:** Status badges and Latency indicators. Automatic ping checks with customizable intervals.
- **Encrypted Keychain:** Store encrypted keys/identities that you can reuse in hosts. Comes with useful features such as "Add to Host" to quickly add a public key to an host.
- **Command Palette (Cmd+K):** Search servers, switch teams, and trigger actions instantly.
- **Zero-Knowledge Sync:** Your data is encrypted locally before being synced. We can't read it, and neither can hackers.
- **Multi-Tab Support:** Native-speed tabs integrated into the window title bar.
- **Custom Themes:** Comes with built-in themes and you can make your own and share it !
- **Folders & Tags**
- **Cross-Platform:** Single-binary performance for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Auto-Updates**
- **Status Badges:** Shows hosts status by using ping polling

### ⚡ Pro ($7/mo annual · $9/mo monthly — 14-day free trial, no card)
- **Real-Time Cloud Sync:** High-performance real-time engine using CRDTs for instant, conflict-free merging and SSE for sub-second updates across all devices.
- **Unlimited Private Vaults**
- **Terminal Sharing:** Share a terminal session ad-hoc with 1 guest — great for pair debugging or quick help.

### 👥 Teams ($15/user/mo annual · $18/user/mo monthly — 3-user minimum)
- **Team Vaults:** Shared vaults with easy member invites
- **Shared terminals (unlimited guests)**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Only default roles for teams plan, granular permissions and custom roles are reserved for Business plan to avoid complexity for small teams.
- **Audit Logging**

### 🏢 Business ($30/user/mo — contact us)
- **On-premise self-hosted backend**
- **Priority SLA support**
- **Granular permissions & Custom Roles**
- **Custom contracts**

## 🛡️ Architecture & Security
Voltius is built on a **Local-First, Zero-Knowledge** architecture. Your sensitive data (private keys, passwords, and server metadata) is encrypted on your machine before it ever touches a disk or a network.

### Account & Encryption Tiers
We offer three levels of security to fit your workflow:

- **OS Keychain (Local-Only)**: Uses your system's native secure storage (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Secret Service via keytar/libsecret). No master password required; maximum convenience for local-only use.

- **Master Password:** Encrypts your vault using a user-defined passphrase. Uses Argon2id for key derivation and AES-256-GCM for data encryption.

- **Cloud Account:** Enables seamless E2EE synchronization across devices via our high-speed relay service.

### Zero-Knowledge Synchronization
Whether you use our professional Cloud Sync or our built-in Gist Plugin, we follow a **Zero-Knowledge** protocol.
